a. If you use the X function gen and R, S, Q1 and Q2 as inputs you can show the next 
state of Q1. Then if you use the Y function gen with the inputs of T, Q1 and Q2, 
you can show the next state of Q2. We can show the output P if we use the Z function
gen with the inputs T and then also the X function gen.

F = X6F1 + X'6F2 + X7





For inputs X1, X2, X3, and X4 on X:

    F1 = X'1X2X'3 + X2X'3X'4 + X2X3X'4


For inputs X2, X3, X4, and X5 on Y:

    F2 = X'2X'3X4 + X2X'3X'4 + X'3X4X5

For inputs F1, F2, X6, and X7 on X in the second block:

    F = X6F1 + X'6F2 + X7
