To implement the function f(a, b, c, d, e) using Shannon's Expansion theorem with two LUT4s (Lookup Tables with 4 inputs) and a 2-1 MUX (Multiplexer), we need to compute the values of f1(b, c, d, e) and f2(b, c, d, e) and then use these results along with input a to obtain the final output.

Here's how the implementation would look:

```
          +----+               +----+
    a ----| LUT|--------------| MUX|----> f(a, b, c, d, e)
          |    |              |    |
    b ----| LUT|----+         |    |
          |    |    |         +----+
    c ----| LUT|----+
          |    |
    d ----| LUT|
          |    |
    e ----| LUT|
          +----+
```

Explanation:

1. LUT1: This LUT takes inputs b, c, d, and e. It is programmed to implement the function f1(b, c, d, e) based on the truth table of f(a, b, c, d, e) where a = 0 (complemented value). The output of LUT1 represents f1(b, c, d, e).

2. LUT2: This LUT also takes inputs b, c, d, and e. It is programmed to implement the function f2(b, c, d, e) based on the truth table of f(a, b, c, d, e) where a = 1. The output of LUT2 represents f2(b, c, d, e).

3. MUX: The 2-1 MUX takes the outputs of LUT1 and LUT2 as its inputs. The selection input of the MUX is a. When a = 0, the output of LUT1 (f1(b, c, d, e)) is selected as the output of the MUX. When a = 1, the output of LUT2 (f2(b, c, d, e)) is selected as the output of the MUX.

LUT1 (f1(b, c, d, e)):
Inputs: b, c, d, e
Output: f1(b, c, d, e)

LUT2 (f2(b, c, d, e)):
Inputs: b, c, d, e
Output: f2(b, c, d, e)

MUX:
Inputs: f1(b, c, d, e), f2(b, c, d, e), a
Output: f(a, b, c, d, e)
