To draw the RTL (Register-Transfer Level) hardware realization of the given Verilog code, we need to represent the behavior of the code using hardware components. In this case, we'll be working with data paths, adders, multiplexers, and shift registers.

Here's the RTL hardware realization for the given Verilog code:

```
              +-----------+  +---------+  +----------+
     nibbles  |           |  |         |  |          |
    +-------->|  Nibbles  |->|   MUX   |->|   Adder  |--> sum
              |           |  |         |  |          |
              +-----------+  +---------+  +----------+
                                    ^    |
                                    |    |
                                    |    |
                                    |    |  +-------+
                                    +----|--| Shift |
                                         |  +-------+
                                         |
                                      +--|---+
                                      |  |   |
                                      |  |   v
                                      |  |  +---------+
                                      |  |  |         |
                                      +---->|  Reg.   |
                                         |   last_c  |
                                         +---------+
```

Explanation of blocks:

1. `Nibbles`: This block stores the 16-bit input `nibbles`. It feeds into the MUX and the shift register.

2. `MUX`: The MUX selects between the original `nibbles` or the shifted `n2` based on the value of `c`.

3. `Shift`: This block performs a right shift operation on the 16-bit value `n2`. It is triggered by the positive edge of signal `a` and is active when `c` is high.

4. `Adder`: This block performs the addition operation to calculate the `sum`. It takes the values from the MUX output and the output of the shift register.

5. `Reg. last_c`: This is a register that stores the previous value of signal `c`. It is used to detect when the value of `c` changes, which then triggers the shifting and addition operations.

Please note that this is a conceptual representation of the RTL hardware realization and not an actual circuit diagram. It conveys the high-level functionality of the Verilog code and how it can be implemented using various hardware blocks. In actual hardware design, the components may be more complex, and optimizations may be applied for efficiency and performance.
