To rewrite the given structural Verilog code into a behavioral version, we'll remove the instantiated gates and introduce continuous assignments for logic operations. We'll also include delays as specified in the original code. Note that the delays in behavioral Verilog can be introduced using `#` followed by the delay value.

Here's the behavioral version of the Verilog code:

```verilog
module expl_beh(x, y, a, b, c);
  input a, b, c;
  output x, y;

  wire na, nb, nc;
  not #(1) n1(na, a);
  not #(1) n2(nb, b);
  not #(1) n3(nc, c);

  wire t3, t5, t6;
  and #(1) a1(t3, na, b, c);
  and #(1) a2(t5, a, nb, c);
  and #(1) a3(t6, a, b, nc);

  // Outputs with delays
  reg x_out, y_out;
  always @(t3, t6)
    x_out = t3 | t6;
  always @(a, t5)
    y_out = a | #(3) t5;

  assign x = x_out;
  assign y = y_out;
endmodule
```

In the behavioral version, we removed the instantiations of gates and created continuous assignments (`assign`) for the output signals. The delays were included using the `#` syntax within the `always` blocks. Please note that delays are generally not recommended in behavioral Verilog as they may not be synthesizable. Delays are more appropriate in testbenches for simulation purposes.
