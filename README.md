Lab and Homework for EE4301

## Homeworks

These are my homeworks, they are mostly right. The answer keys are inside as well. Sorry professor, please don't come after me.

## Labs

There are my Vivado lab project files for each lab. Pretty sure nothing really worked, so use at your own risk. Some older lab folders from other people are inside that lab folder. They are available elsewhere on GitHub too. 
There are also my messy lab notebooks where I explained how nothing was working in my lab because I don't know anything about Verilog. My lab reports are going to be in there too.

## Files

This contains relevant files that I used for the courses.
